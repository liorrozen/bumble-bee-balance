The AssetManager must be located at "/as3/AssetManager/AssetManager.as"
First you must load the asset SWF and then add the Loader you used to the AssetManager using the method : addFile(file:Loader)...
once you have done this you can call the getAssetByName(name:string) method and it will return your desired movieclip...  
Paramater (name:string) is the Class name in the Linkage properties window of the movieClip.
